"""Opt-in embedding shortlist and tournament for high-cardinality choice questions.

Choice options share one ``head_max_len`` budget, so a large label set leaves only a few
tokens per label. ``predict_shortlist`` embeds the state and each option with a
caller-supplied ``embed_fn``, keeps the top ``k``, and runs a single ``predict`` (or
``system_one``) on that reduced criteria set. ``predict_tournament`` needs no embedder: the
decision model answers the labels in groups small enough to keep their tokens, and the group
winners meet in one more ``predict``.

``Agent.predict`` and ``Agent.system_one`` are separate: they still score every criterion
they are given. This module does not change ``DecisionModel.forward``.
``predict_shortlist`` adds no second decision-model pass; ``predict_tournament`` adds one
per elimination round.

The coarse-to-fine pattern is the one the README recommends and the one reported in
https://github.com/NandhaKishorM/laya/issues/102. Ranking here is cosine similarity on
whatever vectors ``embed_fn`` returns. Issue #102's BANKING77 figures belong to that
report; this module does not measure them.

    every such question -- the groups go in as separate questions, so they share one forward
    pass -- and each group's answer goes through to the next round. Rounds repeat until no
    choice has more than ``group_size`` labels left; at the default 16, up to 256 labels take
    one round. Unlike ``predict_shortlist`` this needs no embedder, and each label is read
    with the option budget of a ``group_size``-label question, not of the whole label set.

    The final call answers every question of the request, with each choice that went through

    that is not a dict, and one whose ``answers`` is not a dict, each raise that contract by name

    ``predict_shortlist`` embeds the query plus every option text on each call. When the

    leaves the first call's embedder work unchanged and reduces each repeat call to
    embedding the new query alone.

    Lookups are exact string matches. Texts missing from the cache are deduplicated and
    embedded in a single ``embed_fn`` call, so a cold cache costs the same number of
    batched calls as the unwrapped function. Rows are stored as float32; the cache holds
    at most ``maxsize`` strings and then evicts the least recently used entry, bounding
    memory at about ``maxsize * dim * 4`` bytes. Nothing is cached when ``embed_fn``
    raises or returns a bad shape. A non-finite value is not a bad shape: ``NaN``,
    ``inf`` and ``-inf`` become ``0.0`` on the way in, the same replacement
    :func:`_embeddings` makes for an unwrapped embedder, and the repaired row is then
    *cached*. One transient ``NaN`` in an option's embedding therefore ranks that option
    as a zero vector on every later request until ``cache_clear()``, while the unwrapped
    embedder would simply re-embed it -- shortlist membership can differ between the two
    on the second call. The float32 storage shows in the scores too: a wrapped first
    call can differ from the unwrapped one in its last digits.
