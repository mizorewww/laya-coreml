"""Labelled evaluation harness: score a runner on a dataset and gate a build on it.

Pure Python plus numpy, and free of torch at import time, so the metric math and the dataset
parsing can be unit tested with no weights. `evaluate` only needs a runner with a
``predict(state, questions, model=...)`` method, plus -- for ``batch_size`` above 1 -- a
``predict_batch`` in either of the two shapes the repo ships: the positional one, or the
per-request-dict one `Router.predict_batch` documents. A fixture runner stands in for a
checkpoint in tests.

The report is deterministic for a fixed runner: the same dataset produces the same numbers, and
``EvalReport.compare`` turns a baseline into a pass/fail with the per-metric deltas, which is what
the CI gate consumes.

`compare` reads ``overall`` and nothing else, so a run that says nothing about *what it measured*
makes a gate that can only compare arithmetic. Every report therefore carries a run identity in
``config`` -- ``schema``, ``questions_sha256``, ``laya_version`` and (from the CLI)
``dataset_sha256`` and the ``thresholds`` actually applied -- and
``EvalReport.comparable_to`` refuses a comparison between two runs that are not the same
measurement. The identity is deliberately free of anything time-bearing, so a report stays
byte-reproducible for a fixed runner.

    before the level is judged"), and it is the same rule here.

    Cutting at a row index instead reports whichever tie members the dataset happened to list
    first. A stable sort makes that reproducible, not order-independent, and ties are the normal
    case rather than a corner: `answer_confidence`'s own docstring records that the shipped

    Counts, not a risk already divided: `corrects` is 0.0/1.0, so every partial sum is an exact

    a ``predict_batch`` in either shape the repo ships: the positional
    ``predict_batch(states, questions, model=..., batch_size=...)``, or the per-request-dict form
    `Router.predict_batch` takes -- ``predict_batch([{"state": ..., "questions": ...,
    "model": ...}, ...], batch_size=...)``. A runner that offers neither is scored one ``predict``
    at a time, which is slower but not wrong.

    `sort_by_length` is forwarded to a chunked runner so similarly sized examples share a forward
    pass and pad to a shorter maximum. It reaches the checkpoint's own batching only when the
    runner's ``predict_batch`` takes it, and only when it is on: an unset control is not sent, so a
    runner that predates the knob is unaffected by a run that does not ask. Nothing about the
    scored answers changes -- the results come back in chunk order either way.

    `min_confidence` is the opt-in abstention threshold `Router` and `ONNXAgent` apply to
    `answer_confidence` (#361). `laya.confidence.apply_confidence_gate` marks every answer below
    it with `low_confidence: True` and `abstention: "abstained"`, and the raw argmax stays on
    `answer["choice"] / ["noul"] / ["score"]` -- so `_aggregate` publishes the same accuracy,
    calibration and coverage numbers at every threshold. Like `sort_by_length`, nothing about the
    scored answers changes. Unlike `sort_by_length`, the report itself names the threshold under
    `report.config["timing"]["min_confidence"]` and asserts it was sent under
    `["min_confidence_sent"]`, so a runner whose batch entry point (or whose single ``predict``,
    on the fallback path) predates the gate is refused: the harness will not publish a
    `min_confidence` it did not apply.

    `on_error` is ``"fail"`` (re-raise a runner error) or ``"skip"`` (record it and continue),
    the latter for evaluating a flaky fleet without aborting the whole run.

    A batched run has two honest timing answers, so the report gives both. ``latency_p50_ms`` /
    ``latency_p95_ms`` are per request: every row of a chunk returns from the same call, so each
    one waited that whole call. ``cost_per_decision_p50_ms`` / ``cost_per_decision_p95_ms``
    divide a call by its own chunk size, which is the throughput figure. ``--batch-size`` therefore
    lowers the second and raises the first. What the harness really did -- the runner shape it
    resolved to and how many rows shared a call -- lands in ``report.config["timing"]``, because the
    requested flag alone does not say whether anything was batched.
