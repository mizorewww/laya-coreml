Routing (the default) never downloads a checkpoint, so it works offline and
returns in milliseconds. --predict loads the routed checkpoint on first use,
which needs network access to the Hugging Face hub. --preset answers one of the
ready-made question presets from laya_coreml.presets and implies --predict.
--batch scores a whole file (or stdin, with `-`) through Router.predict_batch in one
process, so the states share checkpoint loads and forward passes; --json prints JSONL.
--questions answers the question set in a JSON file instead; --max-len and --head-max-len
raise its token budget for the request, which is what a many-label question needs,
and --min-confidence marks an answer whose confidence falls below the threshold
instead of changing it (it needs an answering mode: routing has no confidence to gate).
